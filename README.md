# Fitness Club

The website of the fitness club allows the client to make an order of training cycle and pay for it.
The client's personal trainer determines the load and mode, makes recommendations for him (training, exercises, equipment, nutrition).
As a service for clients, there is a system of personal cabinets where they can see recommendations from a personal trainer, find out the schedule of classes. In addition, the client can reject and/or replace some of the recommendations.
Discounts are assigned to corporate and regular clients.
